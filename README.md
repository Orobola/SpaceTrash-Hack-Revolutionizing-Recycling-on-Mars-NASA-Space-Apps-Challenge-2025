# PHOENIX: The Martian Circular Reuse System. From Trash to Tomorrow  
**Transforming Waste into Life — Building Mars Sustainably, Bringing Innovation Back to Earth**

---

## 🚀 Overview  
During a **three-year crewed mission to Mars**, 8 astronauts would generate **~12,600 kg of inorganic waste** — from packaging and textiles to structural materials and EVA equipment [¹]. On Earth, waste is “taken out.” On Mars, there is no “out.” That’s why we built **PHOENIX**: a modular, circular reuse system that turns waste into oxygen-supporting processes, construction feedstock, tools, and filtration materials.

## 🔧 System Concept  
**Inputs → Processing → Outputs**

- **Inputs:** plastics, textiles, foam, aluminum, EVA waste, carbon surplus (from ISRU experiments)  
- **Processing Modules:**  
  - **PMA** – Polymer Melting & Additive (3D printing feedstock)  
  - **RIF** – Regolith-Integrated Fabrication (structural bricks, panels)  
  - **MSU** – Modular Smart Upcycling (tools, furniture, storage)  
  - **CME** – Carbon Material Engineering (filters, insulation)  
- **Outputs:** utensils, containers, panels, interior outfitting, tools, insulation

> **Note on assumptions:** PHOENIX uses NASA-informed baseline figures and literature-inspired processing yields.

## ⚖️ Mass Flow Calculations

### Mission Baseline
- **Crew:** 8 astronauts  
- **Duration:** 3 years  
- **Total Inorganic Waste:** 12,600 kg *(NASA challenge baseline)*  
> Note: Based on NASA’s estimated daily generation rate (~1.44 kg/person/day), an 8-member crew over 3 years would yield ≈ 12,614 kg — validating the challenge’s baseline figure.

## Mission Scenarios (Illustrative)

### 1. Residence Renovations  
Habitat frame & foam packaging → RIF → insulation panels & interior bracing.

### 2. Cosmic Celebrations  
Textiles & pouches → MSU → decorations, reusable cups, morale-boosting artifacts.

### 3. Daring Discoveries  
O₂ extraction experiments → surplus carbon → CME → water/air filters & thermal insulation.
